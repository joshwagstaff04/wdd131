        <h3>1. Track Every Dollar</h3>
        <p>
          The foundation of good budgeting is knowing where your money goes. Record every income and expense, no matter how small. 
          Over time, you'll start seeing patterns in your spending that can help you make better financial decisions.

        <h3>2. Create a Budget That Works for You</h3>
        <p>
          There's no one-size-fits-all budget. Whether you prefer the 50/30/20 rule (50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings) or another method, 
          choose a system you'll actually stick with. Your budget is a personal tool, not a punishment.

        <h3>3. Set Realistic Goals</h3>
        <p>
          Don't try to overhaul your entire financial life overnight. Start with small, achievable goals like saving $50 per month. 
          Once you succeed, increase your goal. Small wins build momentum and confidence.

        <h3>4. Build an Emergency Fund</h3>
        <p>
          Life happens. Job loss, medical emergencies, car repairs—these unexpected costs are much easier to handle if you have an 
          emergency fund. Aim to save 3-6 months of living expenses over time.

        <h3>5. Use the 50/30/20 Rule</h3>
        <p>
          Allocate 50% of your after-tax income to needs (housing, food, utilities), 30% to wants (entertainment, dining out), 
          and 20% to savings and debt repayment. This creates a balanced approach to spending.

        <h3>6. Cut Unnecessary Subscriptions</h3>
        <p>
          Review your subscriptions monthly—streaming services, apps, memberships. Cancel what you don't use regularly. 
          These small monthly charges add up quickly and are often forgotten until they hit your account.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Meal Plan to Save Money</h3>
        <p>
          Food is often the easiest category to cut spending. Plan your meals, make a grocery list, and stick to it. 
          Cooking at home saves significantly compared to eating out or ordering delivery.
        </p>

      <article class="tip-card">
        <h3>8. Pay Yourself First</h3>
        <p>
          Set up automatic transfers to savings before you spend money on anything else. When saving happens automatically, 
          you're more likely to follow through rather than saving what's left over.
        </p>

      <article class="tip-card">
        <h3>9. Use Cash for Variable Expenses</h3>
        <p>
          For categories where you tend to overspend (entertainment, shopping), try using cash. The physical act of handing over 
          money makes spending feel more real and can help curb impulse purchases.
        </p>

      <article class="tip-card">
        <h3>10. Review Your Budget Monthly</h3>
        <p>
          Set aside time each month to review your spending. Celebrate wins, identify overspending areas, and adjust your budget 
          for the coming month. Consistency and review are keys to long-term success.
        </p>

      <article class="tip-card">
        <h3>11. Avoid Lifestyle Inflation</h3>
        <p>
          When you get a raise or bonus, don't immediately increase your spending. Consider directing at least half of the increase 
          to savings or debt reduction. This prevents the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle.
        </p>

      <article class="tip-card">
        <h3>12. Practice the 30-Day Rule</h3>
        <p>
          Before making a non-essential purchase, wait 30 days. Often, the urge to buy passes. This simple rule helps distinguish 
          between genuine needs and impulse purchases, saving you money over time.

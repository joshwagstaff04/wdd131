    The purpose of this website is to help users track their income, expenses, and savings goals
    in a simple and organized way. Users will be able to enter income and expense amounts, see
    totals, and track progress toward a savings goal. All data will be stored locally in the
    browser so users can return without losing their information.

    <li>How much money do I have left after paying my monthly expenses?</li>
    <li>Am I making progress toward my savings goal?</li>

  <h2>Reason for Choosing This Project</h2>
  <p>
    I chose this project because I want to learn how to use forms and local storage in JavaScript. I also think a budget tracker is something useful that people could actually use, not just a random assignment.
